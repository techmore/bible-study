          <h4>NIV or NLT</h4>
          <p>
            Use NIV or NLT when you want the story to make sense in clear modern English. This is especially
            helpful when reading John for the first time.

            Check a more literal or middle-ground translation when a verse feels important, dense, or
            confusing. Differences often show where the original wording carries nuance.
