# Quiz Coverage Plan

This file is the planning source for the quiz system. The website can keep a smaller curated question bank in `reference.js`, while this document tracks the full target coverage, useful references, and generation rules.

## Goal

Build quizzes that help a beginner move from recognition to understanding:

- Section quizzes: Torah/Pentateuch, historical books, biblical novellas, wisdom books, prophets, Gospels, Acts, letters, Catholic letters, Revelation.
- Book quizzes: one quiz for every biblical book in the canon list below.
- Chapter quizzes: one short quiz for every chapter where chapter-level comprehension matters.
- Random practice: 25, 50, 100, or all available questions from the full bank, optionally narrowed by search.
- Complete checks: end-of-book and whole-Bible quizzes that test sequence, people, places, themes, and timeline.

## Canon Note

The list below follows the broader Catholic-style canonical order the user provided, including deuterocanonical books such as Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, and 1-2 Maccabees. The app should eventually explain canon differences without making the beginner feel like one tradition is being smuggled in silently.

For Protestant-focused tracks, mark deuterocanonical books as "Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical context" instead of removing them. For Catholic-focused tracks, keep them in the main Old Testament sequence.

## Quiz Design Rules

Every quiz should include:

- Recall: names, order, people, places, repeated terms.
- Comprehension: what happened and why it matters.
- Context: where the book/chapter sits in the larger Bible story.
- Vocabulary: terms a beginner would otherwise miss.
- Synthesis: how the passage points toward Jesus, covenant, kingdom, wisdom, worship, exile, restoration, church, or new creation.

Avoid trivia-only quizzes. A good question should help someone reread the passage better.

## Question Types

- `identify`: Who is speaking? Who is involved? Where is this?
- `sequence`: What comes before or after this?
- `meaning`: What does this word, sign, or event mean in context?
- `theme`: What major theme is being developed?
- `connection`: How does this connect to Jesus, the wider Bible, or Christian practice?
- `application`: What should a learner notice, pray, practice, or revisit?

## Suggested Rollout

1. Keep the current `reference.js` quiz bank focused on starter quizzes.
2. Add book-level quizzes next: Genesis, Exodus, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Ephesians.
3. Add section quizzes for Old Testament groupings and New Testament groupings.
4. Add chapter-level quizzes only after book quizzes are solid, starting with John, Luke, Acts, Romans, Genesis, and Exodus.
5. Move to a generated data file if the quiz bank gets too large for `reference.js`.

## Data Structure Target

```js
{
  title: "John 1 Quiz",
  scope: "chapter",
  testament: "New Testament",
  section: "Gospels",
  book: "John",
  chapter: 1,
  questions: [
    {
      type: "meaning",
      prompt: "What title does John use for Jesus at the beginning of the chapter?",
      answer: "John calls Jesus the Word, who was with God and was God.",
      references: ["John 1:1-18"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Open Decisions

- Whether to keep the Catholic/deuterocanonical list as the default or offer tradition filters.
- Whether random quizzes should eventually be scored, not just revealed.
- Whether complete quizzes should require all answers before reveal.
- Whether to use an API for chapter metadata or keep the inventory static.
- Whether to store quiz progress in local storage.
